# Meeting-Attendance Data Analysis with Python
This program analyses the data from a zoom meeting. The data is a text file containing only country codes of meeting attendees. It extracts out the country codes (they are the 2 letters in capital in a bracket, eg GB, AT, DE… etc) and return each country code and their associated counts using a dictionary. It then takes in country code and its associated counts and converts this to a properly formatted country and count using an API with Json mapping eg. We want: {“GB” : 424, “US” : 234, “IN” : 200, …} to become {“United Kingdom” : 424, “United States” : 234, “India” : 200,...}. Finally, it returns the top 20 countries sorted in descending order and a barchat.
